## Overview
**EmbeddedSTM32-BinaryClock** is a project that demonstrates how to create a binary clock using an STM32 microcontroller. The project is written primarily in C and uses a Makefile for the build process. The binary clock displays the current time in binary format using LEDs, providing a unique and educational way to visualize time.

## Features
- **Binary Time Display**: Displays hours, minutes, and seconds in binary format using LEDs.
- **STM32 Microcontroller**: Utilizes an STM32 microcontroller for precise timing and control.
- **Efficient Codebase**: Simple, well-structured, and easy-to-understand code.
- **Custom PCB**: Includes a custom-designed PCB for a clean and professional build.

## Photos

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To build and flash this project, you will need the following:
- **STM32 Development Board** (e.g., STM32F4Discovery)
- **STM32CubeIDE** or any other STM32 development environment
- **Make Utility**
- **ARM GCC Compiler**
- **Flashing Tool** (e.g., ST-Link, OpenOCD)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pedro-nishida/EmbeddedSTM32-BinaryClock.git
   cd EmbeddedSTM32-BinaryClock
   ```
2. Build the project using the provided Makefile:
   ```sh
   make
   ```
3. Flash the binary to your STM32 board using your preferred flashing tool.

### Usage
1. Connect the LEDs to the appropriate GPIO pins on the STM32 board as defined in the code.
2. Power up the STM32 board.
3. The LEDs will display the current time in binary format.
